<h2>Notes.</h2>


<h3>JACK.</h3>

<p>I wish to note, and to suggest to students in ethnology, the Query, how
it comes to pass that John Bull has a peculiar propensity to call things
by his own name, his familiar appellative of <i>Jack</i>?</p>

<p>Of all the long list of abbreviations and familiar names with which
times past and present have supplied us, that which honest Falstaff
found most pleasing to his ears, "<i>Jack</i> with my familiars!" is the
household word with which ours are most conversant. Were not <i>Jack</i> the
Giant-killer, <i>Jack</i> and the Bean-stalk, and Little <i>Jack</i>, the
intimates of our earliest days? when we were lulled to sleep by ditties
that told of <i>Jack</i> Sprat and his accommodating wife (an instance of the
harmony in which those of opposite tastes may live in the bonds of
wedlock); of <i>Jack</i>, the bachelor who lived harmoniously with his
fiddle, and had a soul above the advice of his utilitarian friend; of
<i>Jack</i> who, like Caliban, was to have a new master; of <i>Jack</i><a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> the
brother of Gill; and of the <i>Jack</i> who was only remarkable for having a
brother, whose name, as a younger son, is not thought worthy of mention.
And were not our waking hours solaced by songs, celebrating the good
Jack<a id="footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>, little <i>Jack</i> Horner, and holding up to obloquy the bad Jack,
naughty <i>Jacky</i> Green, and his treachery to the innocent cat? Who does
not remember the time when he played at <i>jack</i>-straws, fished for
<i>jack</i>-sharps, and delighted in a skip-<i>jack</i>, or <i>jack</i>-a-jumper, when
<i>jack</i>-in-a-box came back from the fair (where we had listened not
unmoved to the temptations of that eloquent vagabond cheap-<i>Jack</i>) and
popped up his nose before we could say <i>Jack</i><span class='pagenum'><a id="page326" name="page326"></a>{326}</span> Robinson; and when
<i>Jack</i>-in-the-green ushered in May-day? While a halo of charmed
recollections encircles the memory of <i>Jack</i>-pudding, dear to the
Englishman as Jack Pottage and Jack Sausage (Jean Potage and Hans Wurst)
are to Frenchman and German.</p>

<p>Our childhood past, <i>Jack</i> still haunts us at every turn and phase of
our existence. The smoke-<i>jack</i> and bottle-<i>jack</i>, those revolutionary
instruments that threw the turnspit out of employment (and have
well-nigh banished him from the face of the earth), cook the <i>Jack</i>
hare, which we bring in in the pocket of our shooting-<i>jacket</i>. We wear
<i>jack</i>-boots, and draw them off with boot-<i>jacks</i>; prop up our houses
with <i>jack</i>-screws; wipe our hands on <i>jack</i>-towels; drink out of
black-<i>jacks</i>, and wear them on our backs too, at least our ancestors
did; while flap-<i>jacks</i><a id="footnotetag3" name="footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> gave a relish to their Lenten diet,
<i>jack</i>-of-the-clock<a id="footnotetag4" name="footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> told them the hour; <i>Jack</i> priests held rule over
them; and gentle exercise at the <i>jack</i>, at bowls, helped them to digest
their dinners. We ride upon <i>jack</i>-asses; <i>jacks</i> flourish in our
fish-ponds; <i>jack</i>-a-lanterns and <i>jack</i>-snipes flit over our bogs, the
one scarcely less difficult to capture than the other; <i>jack</i>-daws
multiply in our steeples, and <i>jack</i>-herons still linger about our
baronial halls.</p>

<p>The four <i>jack</i> knaves, <i>jack</i>-a-lents, <i>jack</i>-a-dandies,
<i>jack</i>-a-nasties, and <i>jacks</i>-in-office (<i>jack</i>-an-apeses every man
<i>jack</i> of them), with that name fraught with mysterious terror, <i>Jack</i>
Ketch, are the scape-graces of this numerous family; and, at every
<i>Jack</i> who would be the gentleman, at a saucy <i>Jack</i> who attempts to
play the <i>jack</i> with us, our indignation rises, like that of Juliet's
nurse. But, on the whole, <i>Jack</i> is an honest fellow, who does his work
in this life, though he has been reproached with Tom's helping him to do
nothing; but let the house that Jack built vindicate him from this
calumny. <i>Jack</i>, we repeat, is an honest fellow, and is so more
especially, when as <i>Jack</i>-tar (Heaven protect him from <i>Jack</i>-sharks
both on sea and shore!) he has old Ocean beneath, and the union-<i>jack</i>
above him. Of black and yellow <i>jack</i>, who are foreigners, we make no
mention; neither of <i>Jack</i>-Spaniards, nor of <i>Jacko</i> the monkey, whom we
detest; but, go where we will, <i>Jack</i> meets us, and is master of all
trades, for that we hold to be the right, though, we are aware, not the
usual version of the saying. In short, with Merry <i>Andrews</i>, <i>Jerry</i>
Sneaks, <i>Tom</i> Noddies, and Silly <i>Simons</i>, we may all have a casual
acquaintance; but <i>Jack</i>, sweet <i>Jack</i>, kind <i>Jack</i>, honest <i>Jack</i>,
<i>Jack</i> still is our familiar.</p>

<p> Jack and Gill were measures. "Wherefore," says
Grumio, "be the Jacks fair within and the Gills fair without,"
meaning the leathern jacks clean within, and the metal gills
polished without.</p>

<p> His character has suffered by antiquarian
research, which tells us that the song was made on a Colonel
Horner, intrusted by the last Abbot of Wells with a pie,
containing the title-deeds of the abbey, which he was to
deliver to Henry VIII., and that he abstracted one for his own
purposes, whereupon the abbot was hanged.</p>

<h3>MYTHE VERSUS MYTH.</h3>

<p>When I first began to write on Mythology, I followed the Germans in
using <i>mythus</i> for the Greek
<span title="mythos">&#956;&#8166;&#952;&#959;&#962;</span>.
I afterwards thought it
would be better to Anglicise it, and, strange to say, I actually found
that there was a rule in the English language without an exception. It
was this: Words formed from Greek disyllables in <span title="os">&#959;&#962;</span>, whether
the penultimate vowel be long or short, are monosyllables made long by
<i>e</i> final. Thus, not only does <span title='bôlos'>&#946;&#8182;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span> make <i>bole</i>,
but <span title='polos'>&#960;&#972;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span> <i>pole</i>,
<span title='poros'>&#960;&#972;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span> <i>pore</i>,
<span title='skopos'>&#963;&#954;&#972;&#960;&#959;&#962;</span> <i>scope</i>,
<span title='tonos'>&#964;&#972;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> <i>tone</i>, &amp;c.;
so also <span title='gyros'>&#947;&#8166;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span>, <i>gyre</i>;
<span title='thymos'>&#952;&#973;&#956;&#959;&#962;</span>, <i>thyme</i>;
<span title='stylos'>&#963;&#964;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span>, <i>style</i>;
<span title='kybos'>&#954;&#973;&#946;&#959;&#962;</span>, <i>cube</i>, &amp;c.: I
therefore, without hesitation, made an English word <i>my&#772;the</i>. Mr.
Grote, in his <i>History of Greece</i>, has done the very same thing, and
probably on the same principles, quite independently of me; for, as I am
informed, he has never condescended to read my <i>Mythology of Greece and
Italy</i>, perhaps because it was not written in German. We have had no
followers, as far as I am aware, but Miss Lynn, in her classical novels,
and Mr. J. E. Taylor, in his translation of the <i>Pentamerone</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Meantime the English language had got another form of
<span title='mythos'>&#956;&#8166;&#952;&#959;&#962;</span>,
namely, <i>my&#774;th</i>, which I believe made its first appearance in Mr.
Cooley's <i>Maritime and Inland Discovery</i>, and so has the claim of
priority, if not of correctness. This form has been so generally
adopted, that it seems likely ere long to become a mere slang term. It
is used for every kind of fiction whatever; indeed, I have seen it
employed where the proper word would be <i>hoax</i>. Nay, to make matters
worse, it is actually used of persons. Mrs. Harris, for instance, has
been termed a <i>myth</i>, as also was Robin Hood, not long since, even in
"N. &amp; Q."! I wonder how Apolodorus would have looked, if he had heard
Orion or Polyphemus called a
<span title='mythos'>&#956;&#8166;&#952;&#959;&#962;</span>!</p>

<p>Do I then expect the people of England to surrender their glorious
privilege of going wrong without let or hindrance, in matters of grammar
and etymology? Far from me be such folly and presumption. All I venture
to expect is, that men of learning and good sense will, when they are
speaking or writing about those venerable fictions which once commanded
the assent of polished nations, use the more dignified term <i>my&#772;the</i>,
and the adjective <i>mythic</i>, instead of the hybrid <i>mythical</i>, leaving
the poor unhappy little <i>my&#774;th</i> to be bandied about at the popular
will and pleasure.</p>

<h3>WITCHCRAFT IN 1638.</h3>

<p>I inclose you an extract from an old document in my possession, which
appears to be the examination of two witnesses against one Mary Shepherd
for witchcraft. The nature of the offence is not<span class='pagenum'><a id="page327" name="page327"></a>{327}</span> specified. Perhaps it

<h3>ST. AUGUSTIN AND BAXTER.</h3>

<p>I am not aware that any author has pointed out a remarkable coincidence
in the Confessions of St. Augustin and of Baxter:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Divers sins I was addicted to, and oft committed against my
conscience, which, for the warning of others, I will here
confess to my shame. I was much addicted to the excessive and
gluttonous eating of apples and pears, which, I think, laid
the foundation of the imbecility and flatulency of my
stomach.... To this end, and to concur with naughty boys that
gloried in evil, I have oft gone into other men's orchards and
stolen the fruit, when I had enough at home.... These were my
sins in my childhood, as to which conscience troubled me for a
great while before they were overcome."</p></blockquote>

<p>Sir W. Scott cites the above passages in his <i>Life of Dryden</i>, with
sharp comments on the rigid scruples of the Puritans:</p>

<blockquote><p>"How is it possible," he says, "to forgive Baxter for the
affectation with which he records the enormities of his
childhood?... Can any one read this confession without
thinking of Tartuffe, who subjected himself to penance for
killing a flea with too much anger?..."</p></blockquote>

<p>It probably did not occur to the biographer, that no less illustrious a
saint than Augustin, to whom Puritanism can hardly be imputed, had made
a parallel confession of like early depravity many centuries before.
Enlarging on his own puerile delinquencies, and indeed on the wickedness
of children in general, he confesses that, in company with other
"naughty boys" ("nequissimi adolescentuli"), he not only stole apples,
but stole them for the mere pleasure of the thing, and when he "had
enough at home":</p>

<blockquote><p>"Id furatus sum quod mihi abundabat, et multo melius. Nec e&acirc;
re volebam frui quam furto appetebam; sed ipso furto et
peccato. Arbor erat pirus in vicini&acirc; vine&aelig; nostr&aelig; pomis
onusta, nec form&acirc; nec sapore illecebrosis. Ad hanc excutiendam
atque asportandam, nequissimi adolescentuli perreximus nocte
intempest&acirc;; et abstulimus inde onera ingentia, non ad nostras
epulas, sed vel projicienda porcis, etiamsi aliquid inde
comedimus.... Ecce cor meum, Deus meus, ecce cor meum, quod
miseratus es in imo abyssi!"&mdash;<i>Confessionum</i>, lib. ii. cap.
iv.</p></blockquote>

<p>In comparing the two cases, the balance of juvenile depravity is very
much against the great Doctor of Grace. He does not seem to have had
even a fondness for fruit to plead in extenuation of his larceny. He
robbed orchards by wholesale of apples, which, by his own admission, had
no attractions either of form or flavour to tempt him. Yet the two
anecdotes are so much alike, that one would be inclined to suspect one
story of being a mere recoction of the other if it were possible to
doubt the veracity of Richard Baxter.<span class='pagenum'><a id="page328" name="page328"></a>{328}</span></p>

<p>The incident, however, is one too familiar in schoolboy life to make the
repetition of the story a matter of surprise. The property in an apple
growing within the reach of a boy's hand has from time immemorial been
in peril, and the law itself has not always regarded it as an object of
scrupulous protection. The old laws of the Rheingau, and (if I mistake
not) of some other states, warranted a wayfaring man in picking apples
from any tree, provided he did not exceed the number of three.</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>

<p><i>Subterranean Bells</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 128. 200.).&mdash;In answer to J. J.
S.'s inquiry, I beg to state, that at Crosmere, near Ellesmere,
Shropshire, where there is one of a number of pretty lakes scattered
throughout that district, there is a tradition of a chapel having
formerly stood on the banks of the lake. And it is said that the belief
once was, that whenever the waters were ruffled by wind, the chapel
bells might be heard as singing beneath the surface. This, though
bearing on the subject of "submarine" or "subaqueous," rather than
"subterranean" bells, illustrates, I think, the tradition to which J. J.
S. refers.</p>

<h3>JOHNSONIANA.</h3>

<p>I inclose you a transcript of a letter of Boswell's which I think worthy
of being permanently recorded, and am not aware of its having been
before in print.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Edinburgh, 11th April, 1774.</p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p>When Mr. Johnson and I arrived at Inveraray after our
expedition to the Hebrides, and there for the first time
<i>after many days</i> renewed our enjoyment of the luxuries of
civilised life, one of the most elegant that I could wish to
find was lying for me, a letter from Mr. Garrick. It was a
pineapple of the finest flavour, which had a high zest indeed
amongst the heath-covered mountains of Scotia. That I have not
thanked you for it long ere now is one of those strange facts
for which it is so difficult to account, that I shall not
attempt it. The <i>Idler</i> has strongly expressed many of the
wonderful effects of the <i>vis inerti&aelig;</i> of the human mind. But
it is hardly credible that a man should have the warmest
regard for his friend, a constant desire to show it, and a
keen ambition for a frequent epistolary intercourse with him,
and yet should let months roll on without having resolution,
or activity, or power, or whatever it be, to write a few
lines. A man in such a situation is somewhat like Tantalus
reversed. He recedes, he knows not how, from what he loves,
which is full as provoking as when what he loves recedes from
him. That my complaint is not a peculiar fancy, but deep in
human nature, I appeal to the authority of St. Paul, who
though he had not been exalted to the dignity of an apostle,
would have stood high in fame as a philosopher and orator,
"<i>What I would that do I not.</i>" You need be under no concern
as to your debt to me for the book which I purchased for you.
It was long ago discharged; for believe me, I intended the
book as a present. Or if you rather chuse that it should be
held as an exchange with the epitaphs which you sent me, I
have no objection. Dr. Goldsmith's death would affect all the
club much. I have not been so much affected with any event
that has happened of a long time. I wish you would give me,
who am at a distance, and who cannot get to London this
spring, some particulars with regards to his last appearances.
Dr. Young has a fine thought to this purpose, that every
friend who goes before us to the other side of the river of
death, makes the passage to us the easier. Were our club all
removed to a future world but one or two, <i>they</i>, one should
think, would incline to follow. By all means let me be on your
list of subscribers to Mr. Morrell's <i>Prometheus</i>. You have
enlivened the town, I see, with a musical piece. The prologue
is admirably fancied <i>arripere populum tributim</i>; though, to
be sure, Foote's remark applies to it, that your pro<span class='pagenum'><a id="page329" name="page329"></a>{329}</span>logues
have a culinary turn, and that therefore the motto to your
collection of them should be, <i>Animus jamdudum in Patinis.</i> A
player upon words might answer him, "Any Patinis rather than
your Piety in Pattens." I wonder the wags have not been
quoting upon you, "Whose erudition is a <i>Christmas tale</i>." But
Mr. Johnson is ready to bruise any one who calls in question
your classical knowledge and your happy application of it. I
hope Mr. Johnson has given you an entertaining account of his
Northern Tour. He is certainly to favour the world with some
of his remarks. Pray do not fail to quicken him by word as I
do by letter. Posterity will be the more obliged to his
friends the more that they can prevail with him to write. With
best compliments to Mrs. Garrick, and hoping that you will not
punish me by being long silent, I remain faithfully yours,</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">James Boswell.</span></p>

<h3>Minor Notes.</h3>


<p><i>White Roses.</i>&mdash;In an old newspaper, <i>The Weekly Journal, or British
Gazetteer</i>, of Saturday, June 15, 1723, I find the following paragraph:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Monday being the anniversary of the White Roses, some persons
who had a mind to boast that they had bid defiance to the
government, put them on early in the morning; but the mob not
liking such doings, gathered about them, and demolished the
wearers; which so terrified the crew, that not one of them
afterwards would touch a white rose."</p></blockquote>

<p>Can you, or any of your correspondents, explain this curious allusion?
Is it to the emblem of the House of York, or the badge of the Pretender?</p>

<p class="author">E. G. B.</p>


<p><i>Fifeshire Pronunciation.</i>&mdash;I have observed, in various parts of
Fifeshire, a singular peculiarity in the pronunciation of certain words,
of which the following are specimens:</p>

<p>This strange mode is not altogether confined to the most illiterate
portion of the people. My query is, Does this peculiarity obtain in any
other portion of Scotland?</p>

<p><i>Original Letter.</i>&mdash;The following letter, written by the French general
at Guadaloupe, when it was taken in 1810, to his conqueror, is an
exquisite specimen of something more than that national politeness which
does not desert a Frenchman even in misfortune. I possess the original:</p>

<blockquote><p class="author">

<p><i>Erroneous Forms of Speech.</i>&mdash;Since you allow your correspondents to
correct such words as <i>teetotal</i>, I hope you will allow me to call the
attention of your agricultural readers to the corruption in the word
<i>mangold</i>, as they now write it. The word is in German <i>mangel wurzel</i>,
root of scarcity. It is wrong to use even such a name as this, in my
opinion, while we have the English name <i>beet</i>, which has the additional
advantage of being derived from the botanical name <i>Beta</i>. But if a new
name must be used, let it, at any rate, be the pure German <i>mangel</i>, and
not the mongrel <i>mangold</i>. Indeed, those who spell the word in the
latter way, ought in common consistency to write <i>reddishes,</i>
<i>sparrowgrass</i>, and <i>cowcumbers</i> for radishes, asparagus, and cucumbers.</p>

<h2>QUERIES.</h2>


<h3>EUSTACHE DE SAINT PIERRE.</h3>

<p>(Vol. vii., p. 10.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. King's</span> inquiry reminds me of two Queries on the same
subject which I sent you as far back as the end of 1851, or beginning of
1852. Those Queries have not appeared in "N. &amp; Q.," and I was led to
suppose, either that you had laid them aside for some future occasion,
or had found something objectionable in the form in which they were
presented. The following is a literal copy.</p>

<blockquote><p>"There are two circumstances connected with this event (the
surrender of Calais), respecting which I am desirous of
obtaining information. The first has reference to the
individuals who offered themselves as victims to appease the
exasperation of Edward III., after the obstinate siege<span class='pagenum'><a id="page330" name="page330"></a>{330}</span> of
that town in 1347. They are represented as <i>six</i> of the
principal citizens; Eustache de Saint Pierre was at their
head, and the names of three others have come down to us, as
Jean d'Aire, Jacques de Wissant, and Pierre de Wissant. Who
were the other two?</p>

<p>"The second point relates to the character of that occurrence.
Some historians are of opinion that the devotedness of Saint
Pierre and his associates was prompted by the most exalted
sentiments of patriotism; while others assert that it was all
a 'sham,' that Saint-Pierre was secretly attached to the cause
of the English monarch, and that he was subsequently employed
by him in some confidential negociations. To which of these
opinions should the historical inquirer give his assent?"</p></blockquote>

<p>I may add, in reply to <span class="smcap">Mr. King</span>, that "the light thrown on the
subject, through M. de Br&eacute;quigny's labours," has been noticed in the
<i>Biographie Universelle</i>, sub voce <i>Saint-Pierre (Eustache de)</i>; and it
was the remarks in that work that first drew my attention to it. The
circumstances disclosed by Br&eacute;quigny are also commented upon by L&eacute;vesque
in his <i>La France sous les Valois</i>.</p>

<h3>PASSAGE IN COLERIDGE.</h3>

<p>De Quincy, in his "Suspiria de Profundis," Blackwood's <i>Magazine</i>, June,
1845, p. 748., speaking of the spectre of the Brocken, and of the
conditions under which that striking phenomenon is manifested, observes
that</p>

<blockquote><p>"Coleridge ascended the Brocken on the Whitsunday of 1799 with
a party of English students from Goettingen, but failed to see
the phantom; afterwards in England (and under the same three
conditions) he saw a much rarer phenomenon, which he described
in the following eight lines. I give them from a corrected
copy. The apostrophe in the beginning must be understood as
addressed to an ideal conception:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"'And art thou nothing? Such thou art as when</p>
<p class="i075">The woodman winding westward up the glen</p>
<p class="i075">At wintry dawn, when o'er the sheep-track's maze</p>
<p class="i075">The viewless snow-mist weaves a glist'ning haze,</p>
<p class="i075">Sees full before him, gliding without tread,</p>
<p class="i075">An image with a glory round its head:</p>
<p class="i075">This shade he worships for its golden hues,</p>
<p class="i075">And makes (not knowing) that which he pursues.'"</p>
</div></div>
</blockquote>

<p>These lines are from "Constancy to an ideal Object;" but in the usual
editions of Coleridge's <i>Poems</i>, the last two lines are printed thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"The enamour'd rustic worships its fair hues,</p>
<p class="i05">Nor knows he makes the shadow he pursues."</p>
<p class="i2">Coleridge's <i>Poetical Works</i>, vol. ii. p. 91., 1840.</p>
</div></div>
</blockquote>

<p>Query: Which reading is the correct one? Coleridge refers to the
<i>Manchester Philosophical Transactions</i> for a description of this
phenomenon; but, as the earlier volumes of these are scarce, perhaps
some of your correspondents would copy the description from the volume
which contains it, or furnish one from some authentic source.</p>

<h3>Minor Queries.</h3>


<p><i>Cann Family.</i>&mdash;Can any of your correspondents enlighten me as to the
origin of this family name; and if of foreign extraction, as I suspect,
in what county of England they first settled? There is a village in
Dorsetshire called Cann St. Rumbold. Possibly this may afford some clue.
Burke informs us that William Cann, Esq., was Mayor of Bristol in 1648,
and that his son, Sir Robert Cann, also Mayor, and afterwards M.P. for
that city, was knighted by Charles II. in 1662, and created a Baronet,
September 13th in the same year. The title became extinct in 1765, by
the death of Sir Robert Cann, the sixth Baronet. The first Baronet had
several brothers, some of whom most probably left issue, as I find a
respectable family of that name now, and for many years past, located in
Devonshire; but I am not aware if they are descended from the same
stock.</p>

<p><i>Landholders in Lonsdale South of the Sands.</i>&mdash;In his <i>History of

principal landholders in Lonsdale South of the Sands, in the time of
James I., has been kept; but he does not state where the return is
registered, nor whether it was in a private or public form. In fact, it
is impossible to make any reference to the return, from the brief
mention made of it by Baines.</p>

<p>Perhaps some one of your Lancashire correspondents may be acquainted
with the sources of the learned historian's information. If so, it would
much oblige your correspondent to be directed to them, as also to any of
the Lancashire genealogical authorities referring to the district of
Lonsdale South of the Sands.</p>

Trinity Church, Coventry; viz. Arg. on a chev. sa. three <i>stars</i> of the
first. There is a mitre over this coat.</p>

<p>Can any of the correspondents of "N. &amp; Q." assign the family names to
these arms? Does the mitre necessarily imply a bishop or mitred abbot;
and, if not, does it belong to John de Ruggeley, who was Abbot of
Merevale (not far from Coventry) temp. Hen. VI., one branch of whose
family bore&mdash;Arg. on a chev. sa. three <i>mullets</i> of the first. I may
observe that this John was perhaps otherwise connected with Coventry;
for Edith, widow of Nicholas de Ruggeley, his brother, left a legacy,
says Dugd., p. 129., to an anchorite mured up at Stivichall Church, a
member of St. Michael's Church, Coventry.</p>

surplice differ from that worn by a lay vicar, or vicar choral? I have
been an old choir-boy; and some few years since, as a boy, used to
remark that the priests' surplices worn at St. Paul's, the Chapel Royal,
and Westminster Abbey, were, as a sempstress would term it, <i>gaged</i>, or
stitched down in rows over the shoulders some seven or eight times at
the distance of about half an inch from each other. In the cathedral
churches of Durham, York, Hereford, Worcester, Gloucester, and Oxford, I
have remarked their almost universal adoption; but, to the best of my
belief, I have never seen such a description of vestment in use among
parochial clergymen, above half-a-dozen times, and I am desirous of
knowing if the <i>gaged</i> surplice is peculiar to cathedrals and collegiate
churches (I have even seen canons residentiary in them, habited in the
lay vicar's surplice), or is the surplice used by choristers,
undergraduates, and vicars choral, which, according to my early
experience, is one without needlework, the correct officiating garment;
the latter is almost universally used at funerals, where the officiating
priest seldom wears either his scarf or hood, and presents anything but
a dignified appearance when he crowns this <i>n&eacute;glig&eacute;e</i> with one of our
grotesque chimney-pot hats, to the exclusion of the more appropriate
college cap.</p>

<p><i>John, Brother German to David II.</i>&mdash;Can any of your readers solve the
problem in Scotch history, who was John, brother german to King David
II., son of Robert Bruce? David II., in a charter to the Priory of
Rostinoth, uses these words: "Pro salute anim&aelig; nostr&aelig;, etc., ac ob
benevolentiam et affectionem specialem quam erga dictum prioratum devote
gerimus eo quod ossa celebris memori&aelig; Johannis fratris nostri germani
ibidem (the Priory) humata quiescunt dedimus, etc., viginti marcas
sterlingorum, etc." Dated at Scone, "in pleno parliamento nostro tento
ibidem decimo die Junii anno regni sexto decimo."</p>

<p>The expression "celebris memori&aelig;" might almost be held to indicate that
John had lived to manhood, but is perhaps only a style of royalty;
nevertheless, the passage altogether seems to lead to the inference,
that the person had at least survived the age of infancy. King Robert's
bastard son, Sir Robert Bruce, had a grant of the lands of Finhaven, in
the neighbourhood of Rostinoth.<a id="footnotetag6" name="footnotetag6"></a><a href="#footnote6"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p>Is there any better or other account of this priory, church, and chapel
than that given in the <i>Monasticon</i>? Judging by the statement copied by
Mr. Lysons from the original entry in the books of the College of Arms,
the chapel must have been a splendid building. Sir Thomas Lovel was
buried there on the 8th June, 1525, "in a tombe of whyte marbell which
both hit and the chappell were founded by hym, and it stondeth on the
southe syde of the quyre of the saide churche." At his funeral there
were present the Bishop of London, Lord St. John, Sir Richard Wyngfield,
and many others, nobles and gentlemen. The Abbot of Waltham, the Prior
of St. Mary Spital, four orders of friars, the Mayor and all the
aldermen of London, the gentlemen of the Inns of Court, the Lord
Steward, and all the clerks of London, &amp;c., also attended. What a
contrast to the present condition of the place, now a scavenger's yard,
once the apparently last resting-place of the councillor of a mighty

marriage ring among the Jews (<i>Popular Antiq.</i>, vol. ii. p.

detailed account of its origin:&mdash;"The reason," he says, "why a
ring was pitched upon for the pledge rather than anything else
was, because anciently the ring was a <i>seal</i>, by which all
orders were signed, and things of value secured (Gen. xxxviii.
18., Esther iii. 10. 12., 1 Maccab. vi. 15.); and therefore
the delivery of it was a sign that the person to whom<span class='pagenum'><a id="page333" name="page333"></a>{333}</span> it was
given was admitted into the highest friendship and trust (Gen.
xli. 42.). For which reason it was adopted as a ceremony in
marriage to denote that the wife, in consideration of her
being espoused to the man, was admitted as a sharer in her
husband's counsels, and a joint-partner in his honour and
estate: and therefore we find that not only the <i>ring</i>, but
the <i>keys</i> also were in former times delivered to her at the
marriage. That the ring was in use among the old Romans, we
have several undoubted testimonies (Juvenal, <i>Sat.</i> vi. ver.
26, 27.; Plin. <i>Hist. Nat.</i>, lib. iii. c. i.; Tertull.
<i>Apol.</i>, c. vi. p. 7. A.). Pliny, indeed, tells us, that in
his time the Romans used an iron ring without any jewel; but

<h3>HAMILTON QUERIES.</h3>

<p>(Vol. vii., p. 285.)</p>

<p>On reference to the Peerages of Sir Harris Nicolas and Wood, I feel no
doubt that the father of Lord Spencer Hamilton, as <span class="smcap">Tee Bee</span>
remarks, was the fifth Duke of Hamilton, and not the third, as Collins
(edition Brydges) states, who misled me. Perhaps the perplexity, if any,
arose from Anne Duchess of Hamilton, the inheritress of the ducal
honours by virtue of the patent of 1643, after the deaths of her father
and uncle <i>s. p. m.</i>, having obtained a <i>life dukedom</i> for her husband,
William Earl of Selkirk, and, subsequently to his decease, having
surrendered all her titles in favour of their eldest son, James Earl of
Arran, who was in 1698 made Duke of Hamilton, with the same precedency
of the original creation of 1643, as if he had succeeded thereto.</p>

<p>Sir William Hamilton, the ambassador, married first, Jan. 25, 1752, the
only child of Hugh Barlow, Esq., of Lawrenny in Pembrokeshire, with whom
he got a large estate: she died at Naples, Aug. 25, 1782, and was buried
in Wales. His second lady was Emma Harte, a native of Hawarden in
Flintshire; where her brother, then a bricklayer working for the late
Sir Stephen Glynne, was pointed out to me forty years ago. In Wood's
<i>Peerage</i> it is stated that Sir W. Hamilton's second marriage took place
at London, Sept. 6, 1794: he died in April, 1803, and was buried in
Slebech Church.</p>

<p>I well remember Single-speech Hamilton, who was a fried of the family,
dining with my father when I was a little boy; and I still retain the
impression of his having been a tall and thin old gentleman, very much
out of health. He left a treatise called <i>Parliamentary Logick</i>,
published in 1808. The brief memoir of the author prefixed to the work,
makes no mention of him as a member of the House of Hamilton; but it is
said that he derived his name of Gerard from his god-mother Elizabeth,
daughter of Digby, Lord Gerard of Bromley, widow of James, fourth Duke
of Hamilton, who fell in the duel with Lord Mohun, which looks as if
some affinity was recognised.<span class='pagenum'><a id="page334" name="page334"></a>{334}</span> The same authority tells us that William
Gerard Hamilton was the only child of a Scotch advocate, William
Hamilton, by Hannah Hay, one of the sisters of David Bruce, the
Abyssinian traveller; and that he removed to London, and practised with
some reputation at the English bar. Mr. W. G. Hamilton died, unmarried,
in July, 1796, &aelig;t. sixty-eight.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Braybrooke</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tee Bee</span> has, by his Queries about Sir W. Hamilton, recalled
some most painful reminiscences connected with our great naval hero.
According to the statement in the <i>New General Biographical Dictionary</i>,
Sir William Hamilton was married to <i>his first wife</i> in the year 1755;
but although it is asserted that she brought her husband 5000<i>l.</i>
a-year, her name is not given. She died in 1782, and in 1791 "he married
Emma Harte, the fascinating, mischievous, and worthless Lady Hamilton."
Pettigrew, in his <i>Memoirs of Nelson</i>, says, that this marriage took
place at St. George's, Hanover Square, <i>on the 6th of September</i>, 1791.
<span class="smcap">Tee Bee</span> will find a full account of Lady H. in the
above-mentioned work of Pettigrew.</p>

<h3>THE WOOD OF THE CROSS.</h3>

<p>(Vol. vii., p. 177.)</p>

<p>I never heard of our Lord's cross having been made of <i>elder</i> wood. The
common idea, legend, or tradition, that prevailed formerly was, that the
upright beam of the cross was made of <i>cedar</i>, the cross-beam of
<i>cypress</i>, the piece on which the inscription was written of <i>olive</i>,
and the piece for the feet of palm.</p>

<p>The legend concerning the wood of the cross is very curious, and may be
analysed as follows:&mdash;When Adam fell sick, he sent his son Seth to the
gate of the garden of Eden to beg of the angel some drops of the oil of
mercy that distilled from the tree of life. The angel replied that none
could receive this favour till five thousand years had passed away. He
gave him, however, a cutting from the tree, and it was planted upon
Adam's grave. It grew into a tree with three branches. The rod of Moses
was afterwards cut from this tree. Solomon had it cut down to make of it
a pillar for his palace. The Queen of Sheba, when she went to visit
Solomon, would not pass by it, as she said it would one day cause the
destruction of the Jews. Solomon then ordered it to be removed and
buried. The spot where it was buried was afterwards dug for the pool of
Bethsaida, and the mysterious tree communicated the power of healing to
the waters. As the time of the Passion of Christ approached, the wood
floated on the surface of the water, and was taken for the upright beam
of the cross. See this curious legend at greater length in the <i>Gospel
of Nicodemus</i>; the <i>Legenda Aurea</i> at the feasts of the Discovery and
Exaltation of the Cross; Curzon's <i>Monasteries of the Levant</i>, p. 163.;
and Didron's <i>Iconography</i>, p. 367., Bohn's edition.</p>

<p>I think, however, that I can explain the origin of the question put to
<span class="smcap">Rubi</span> by his poor parishioner as to the cross having been made
of <i>elder</i> wood. His question may have sprung from a corruption of an
old tradition or legend regarding not our Saviour, but Judas his
betrayer. Judas is said to have hanged himself on an <i>elder</i> tree. Sir
John Maundeville, in his description of Jerusalem, after speaking of the
Pool of Siloe, adds,</p>

<blockquote><p>"And fast by is still the elder tree on which Judas hanged
himself for despair, when he sold and betrayed our Lord."&mdash;P.
175., Bohn's edit.</p></blockquote>

<p>To return to the wood of the cross. In Sir John Maundeville's time a
spot was pointed out at Jerusalem as the spot where the tree grew:</p>

<blockquote><p>"To the west of Jerusalem is a fair church, where the tree of
the cross grew."&mdash;P. 175.</p></blockquote>

<p>and he speaks of the wood of this tree as having once been used as a
bridge over the brook Cedron (p. 176.). Henry Maundrell describes a
Greek convent that he visited, about half an hour's distance from
Jerusalem:</p>

<blockquote><p>"That which most deserves to be noted in it, is the reason of
its name and foundation. It is because there is the earth that
nourished the root, that bore the tree, that yielded the
timber, that made the cross. Under the high altar you are
shown a hole in the ground where the stump of the tree
stood."&mdash;P. 462.</p></blockquote>

<p>These are some of the legendary traditions regarding the history and
site of the wood of the cross, up to the time of the Passion of Christ.</p>

<h3>EDMUND CHALONER.</h3>

<p>(Vol. vi., p. 292.)</p>

<p>I have been waiting for several months in expectation of seeing some
satisfactory reply to <span class="smcap">Ursula's</span> Query. It seems, however, that,
in common with myself, your numerous correspondents are quite at a
nonplus. Wood, in his <i>Athen&aelig; Oxoniensis</i>, vol. ii. p. 163., mentions
this Edmund Chaloner as being about nineteen (<span class="smcap">Ursula</span> says
twenty-one) years old at the death of his father, James Chaloner, in
1660. Wood, Granger, as also Burke in his <i>Extinct Baronetage</i>,
represent James as being the fourth son of Sir Thomas Chaloner of
Gisborough, in the county of York, and this appears to be the general
impression as to his parentage. In a <i>History of Cheshire</i>, however,
written, I believe, by Cowdray, and published in 1791, the author claims
him as a native of that county, and makes him to be of much<span class='pagenum'><a id="page335" name="page335"></a>{335}</span> humbler
birth and descent than any of his other biographers. Hear him in his own
words:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Our succeeding (Cheshire) collectors form a family harmonic
trio, a father, son, and grandson, of the surname of Chaloner,
and of the several Christian names, Thomas, Jacob, and
<i>James</i>. Thomas was an arms-painter in Chester about 1594; he
knew the value of learning sufficiently to give his son a
better education than he received himself. And this son
followed the same occupation in Chester, and made collections,
about the year 1620. But it was <i>James</i>, the grandson, who
reflected the greatest credit upon his family, by a very
concise, accurate, and sensible account of the Isle of Man,
printed at the end of King's <i>Vale Royal</i>, in 1656. He laid
the foundation of a learned education in our much honoured
college (Brazennoze); and when the parliament invested Lord
Fairfax with the Seignory of Man, he was one of his lordship's
three commissioners for settling the affairs of that island.
The antiquarian collections of all the three Chaloners are
valuable."</p></blockquote>

<p>Without specially binding myself to either one of these conflicting
testimonies, I may be allowed to suggest that, apart from any proof to
the contrary, the inference that he was a native of Chester is a
perfectly fair and legitimate one. His <i>Short Treatise of the Isle of
Man</i>, which was the only work he ever sent to press, was printed at the
end of that famous Cheshire work, the <i>Vale Royal of England</i>, in 1656,
and was illustrated with engravings by Daniel King, the editor of that
work, himself a Cheshire man. Independent of this, his biographer Wood
informs us that he was "a singular lover of antiquities," and that he
"made collections of arms, monuments, &amp;c., in Staffordshire, Salop, and
<i>Chester</i>," the which collections are now, I believe, in the British
Museum. He made no collections for Yorkshire, nor yet for London, where
he is stated by Wood to have been born. One thing is certain, James
Chaloner of Chester was living at the time this treatise was written,
and was, moreover, a famous antiquary, and a collector for this, his
native county; but whether he was, <i>de facto</i>, the regicide, or merely
his cotemporary, I leave it to older and wiser heads to determine.</p>

<h3>"ANYWHEN" AND "SELDOM-WHEN:" UNOBSERVED INSTANCES OF SHAKSPEARE'S USE OF
THE LATTER.</h3>

<h4>(Vol. vii., p. 38.)</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fraser's</span> remark about the word <i>anywhen</i> has brought to my
mind two passages in Shakspeare which have been always hitherto rendered
obscure by wrong printing and wrong pointing. The first occurs in
<i>Measure for Measure</i>, Act IV. Sc. 2., where the Duke says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"This is a gentle provost: <i>seldom-when</i></p>
<p class="i05">The steeled gaoler is the friend of men."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Here the compound word, signifying <i>rarely</i>, <i>not often</i>, has been
always printed as two words; and <span class="smcap">Mr. Collier</span>, following others,
has even placed a comma between <i>seldom</i> and <i>when</i>.</p>

<p>The other passage occurs in the Second Part of <i>King Henry IV.</i>, Act IV.
Sc. 4.; where Worcester endeavours to persuade the king that Prince
Henry will leave his wild courses. King Henry replies:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"'Tis <i>seldom-when</i> the bee doth leave her comb</p>
<p class="i075">In the dead carrion."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Here also the editors have always printed it as two words; and, as
before, <span class="smcap">Mr. Collier</span> here repeats the comma.</p>

<p>That the word was current with our ancestors, is certain; and I have no
doubt that other instances of it may be found. We have a similar
compound in Chaucer's <i>Knight's Tale</i>, v. 7958.:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"I me rejoyced of my lybert&eacute;,</p>
<p class="i05">That <i>selden-tyme</i> is founde in mariage."</p>

has&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"<i>Seldom-what</i>, Gueres souvent."</p>
</div></div>

<p><i>Seldom-when</i>, as far as my experience goes, seems to have passed out of
use where archaisms still linger; but <i>anywhen</i> may be heard any day and
every day in Surrey and Sussex. Those who would learn the <i>rationale</i> of
these words will do well to consult Dr. Richardson's most excellent
<i>Dictionary</i>, under the words <span class="smcap">An, Any, When</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Seldom</span>.</p>

<p>This is at least a step towards <span class="smcap">Mr. Fraser's</span> wish of seeing

<h3>CHICHESTER: LAVANT.</h3>

<h4>(Vol. vii., p. 269.)</h4>

<p>Your correspondent C. affirms, as a mark of the Roman origin of
Chichester, that "the little stream that runs through it is called the
Lavant, <i>evidently from lavando</i>!" Now nobody, as old Camden says, "has

members of the Arch&aelig;ological Institute (who meet next summer upon the
banks of this same <i>Lavant</i>) would decidedly demur to so singular a
proof of it.<span class='pagenum'><a id="page336" name="page336"></a>{336}</span></p>

<p>C. is informed that, in the fourth volume of the <i>Arch&aelig;ologia</i>, p. 27.,
there is a paper by the Hon. Daines Barrington, on the term <i>Lavant</i>,
which, it appears, is commonly applied in Sussex to all brooks which are
dry at some seasons, as is the case with the Chichester river.</p>

<blockquote><p>"From the same circumstance," it is added, "the sands between
Conway and Beaumaris in Anglesey, are called the <i>Lavant
sands</i>, because they are dry when the tide ebbs; as are also
the sands which are passed at low water between Cartmell and
Lancaster, for the same reason."</p></blockquote>

<p>To trace the origin of the term <i>Lavant</i>, we must, I conceive, go back
to a period more remote than the Roman occupation; for that remarkable
people, who conquered the inhabitants of Britain, and partially
succeeded in imposing Roman appellations upon the greater towns and
cities, never could change the aboriginal names of the rivers and
mountains of the country. "Our hills, forests, and rivers," says Bishop
Percy, "have generally retained their old Celtic names." I venture,
therefore, to suggest, that the British word for river, <i>Av</i>, or <i>Avon</i>,
which seems to form the root of the word <i>Lavant</i>, may possibly be
modified in some way by the prefix, or postfix, so as to give, to the
compound word, the signification of an <i>intermittent</i> stream.</p>

<p>The fact that, amidst all the changes which have passed over the face of
our country, the primitive names of the grander features of nature still
remain unaltered, is beautifully expressed by a great poet recently lost
to us:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i7">"Mark! how all things swerve</p>
<p class="i0">From their known course, or vanish like a dream;</p>
<p class="i0">Another language spreads from coast to coast;</p>
<p class="i0">Only, perchance, some melancholy stream,</p>
<p class="i0">And some indignant hills old names preserve,</p>
<p class="i0">When laws, and creeds, and people all are lost!"</p>

<h3>SCARFS WORN BY CLERGYMEN.</h3>

<h4>(Vol. vii., p. 269.)</h4>

<p>The mention of the distinction between the broad and narrow scarf,
alluded to by me (Vol. vii., p. 215.), was made above thirty years ago,
and in Ireland. I have a distinct recollection of the statement as to
what <i>had</i> been the practice, then going out of use. I am sorry that I
cannot, in answer to C.'s inquiry, recollect who the person was who made
it. Nor am I able to specify instances of the partial observance of the
distinction, as I had not till long after learned the wisdom of "making
a note:" but I had occasion to remark that dignitaries, &amp;c. frequently
wore wider scarfs than other clergymen (not however that the narrower
one was ever that slender strip so improperly and servilely adopted of
late from the corrupt custom of Rome, which has curtailed all
ecclesiastical vestments); so that when the discussion upon this subject
was revived by others some years ago, it was one to which my mind had
been long familiar, independently of any ritual authority.</p>

<p>I hope C. will understand my real object in interfering in this subject.
It is solely that I may do a little (what others, I hope, can do more
effectually) towards correcting the very injurious, and, I repeat,
inadequate statement of the <i>Quart. Review</i> for June, 1851, p. 222.
However trifling the matter may be in itself, it is no trifling matter
to involve a considerable portion of the clergy, and among them many who
are most desirous to uphold both the letter and the spirit of the Church
of England, and to resist all real innovation, in a charge of
lawlessness. Before the episcopal authority, there so confidently
invoked, be interposed, let it be <i>proved</i> that this is not a badge of
the clerical order, common to all the churches of Christendom, and
actually recognised by the rules, in every respect so truly Catholic, of
our own Church. The matter does not, I apprehend, admit of demonstration
one way or the other, at least till we have fresh evidence. But to me,
as to many others, analogies seem all in favour of the scarf being such
a badge; and not only this, but the very regulation of our royal
ecclesiastical authorities. The injunctions of Queen Elizabeth, in 1564,
seem to mark the tippet as a distinction between clergymen and laymen,
who otherwise, in colleges and choirs at least, would have none. I also
am strongly of opinion that the tippets mentioned in the 58th and 74th
English canons are the two scarfs referred to: the silken tippet (or
broad scarf) being for such priests or deacons as hold certain offices,
or are M.A., LL.B., or of superior degree; the plain tippet (or narrow
scarf) being for all ministers who are non-graduates (Bachelors of Arts
were not anciently considered as graduates, but rather as candidates for
a degree, as they are still styled in many places abroad); so that <i>all</i>
in orders may have tippets. This notion is confirmed by the fact, that
the scarf was frequently called a <i>tippet</i> in Ireland within memory. And
in a letter, discussing this very subject, in the <i>Gentleman's Mag.</i>
(for 1818, part ii. p. 218.<a id="footnotetag7" name="footnotetag7"></a><a href="#footnote7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>), the testimony of one is given who had
for upwards of fifty years considered the two words as identical, and
had heard them in his youth used indiscriminately by aged clergymen. It
is notorious that in Ireland, time out of mind, <i>tippets</i> have been more
generally worn than <i>hoods</i> in parish churches there. I am not sure
(though I lay no stress on the conjecture) whether this may not have
been in<span class='pagenum'><a id="page337" name="page337"></a>{337}</span> consequence of the option apparently given by the Canons of
wearing <i>either</i> hood or tippet.</p>

<p>It is not correct to restrict the <i>customary</i> use of the scarf to
doctors, prebendaries, and chaplains. In some cathedrals the immemorial
custom has been to assign it to minor canons and clerical vicars also.
At Canterbury, indeed, the minor canons, except otherwise qualified, do
not wear it. (But is not this an exception? Was it always so? And, by
the way, can any cathedral member of old standing testify as to the
customary distinction in his church between the two scarfs, either as to
size or materials?) The very general use of it in towns cannot be
denied.</p>

<p>I may add, that Bishop Jebb used to disapprove of its disuse by country
clergymen. In his Charge he requests that "all beneficed clergymen" of
his diocese "who are <i>Masters of Arts</i>, or of any superior degree, and
who by chaplaincies or otherwise are entitled to the distinction, may
with their surplices wear scarfs or <i>tippets</i>." This apparently was his
construction of the Canons.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">John Jebb</span>.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote">
<p>  <a id="footnote7" name="footnote7"></a> <b>Footnote 7</b>:
    <a href="#footnotetag7">(return)</a></p>
<p> See also p. 315.; and 1819, part i. p. 593.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The narrow scarf, called the stole or orarium, is one of the most
ancient vestments used by the Christian clergy, representing in its
mystical signification the yoke of Christ. Though it may be true that
its use is not enjoined by any modern rubric or canon, custom, I think,
fully warrants the clergy in wearing it. What other sanction than custom
is there for the use of bands?</p>

<p class="author">E. H. A.</p>

<p>A great deal of very interesting matter bearing upon this question, both
in an ecclesiastical and antiquarian point of view, though no definite
conclusion is arrived at, will be found in a pamphlet by G. A. French,
entitled <i>The Tippets of the Canons Ecclesiastical</i>.</p>

<h3>INSCRIPTIONS IN BOOKS.</h3>

<h4>(Vol. vii., p. 127.)</h4>

<p>The following were lines much used when I was at school, and I believe
are still so now:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>A friend was telling me of one of these morsels, which, considering the

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC NOTES AND QUERIES.</h3>


<p><i>Head-rests.</i>&mdash;The difficulty I have experienced in getting my children
to sit for their portraits in a steady position, with the ordinary
head-rests, has led me to design one which I think may serve others as
well as myself; and I therefore will describe it as well as I can
without diagrams, for the benefit of the readers of "N. &amp; Q." It is
fixed to the ordinary shifting upright piece of wood which in the
ordinary rest carries the semicircular brass against which the head
rests. It is simply a large oval ring of brass, about an inch and a half
broad, and sloping inwards, which of the following size I find fits the
back of the head of all persons from young children upwards:&mdash;five
inches in the highest part in front, and about four inches at the back.
It must be lined with velvet, or thin vulcanised India rubber, which is
much better, repelling grease, and fitting quite close to the ring. This
is carried forward by a piece of semicircular brass, like the usual
rest, and fixes with a screw as usual. About half the height of the ring
is a steel clip at each side, like those on spectacles, but much
stronger, about half an inch broad, which moving on a screw or rivet,
after the sitter's head is placed in the ring, are drawn down, so as to
clip the head just above the ears. A diagram would explain the whole,
which has, at any rate, simplicity in its favour. I find it admirable.
Ladies' hair passing through the ring does not prevent steadiness, and
with children the steel clips are perfect. I shall be happy to send a
rough diagram to any one, manufacturers or amateurs.</p>

<p><i>Sir W. Newton's Explanations of his Process.</i>&mdash;In reply to <span class="smcap">Mr. John
Stewart's</span> Queries, I beg to state,</p>

<p>First, That I have hitherto used a paper made by Whatman in 1847, of
which I have a large quantity; it is not, however, to be procured now,
so that I do not know what paper to recommend; but I get a very good
paper at Woolley's, Holborn, opposite to Southampton Street, for
positives, at two shillings a quire, and, indeed, it might do for
negatives.</p>

<p>Secondly, I prefer making the iodide of silver in the way which I have
described.</p>

<p>Thirdly, Soft water is better for washing the iodized paper; if,
however, spring water be made use of, <i>warm</i> water should be added, to
raise it to a temperature of sixty degrees. I think that sulphate or
bicarbonate of lime would be injurious, but I cannot speak with any
certainty in this respect, or to muriate of soda.</p>

<p>Fourthly, The iodized paper should keep good for a year, or longer; but
it is always safer not to make more than is likely to be used during the
season.</p>

<p>Fifthly, If I am going out for a day, I generally excite the paper
either the last thing the night before, or early the following morning,
and develope them the same night; but with care the paper will keep for
two or three days (if the weather is not hot) before exposure, but of
course it is always better to use it during the same day.</p>

<p><i>Talc for Collodion Pictures.</i>&mdash;Should any of your photographic friends
wish to transmit collodion pictures through the post, I would suggest
that thin plates of talc be used instead of glass for supporting the
film; I find this substance well suited to the purpose. One of the many
advantages of its use (though I fear not to be appreciated by your
arch&aelig;ological and antiquarian section) is, that portraits, &amp;c., taken
upon talc can be cut to any shape with the greatest ease, shall I say
suitable for a locket or brooch?</p>

<p><i>Key to Dibdin's "Bibliomania</i>" (Vol. vii., p. 151.).&mdash;There are some
inaccuracies in the list of names<span class='pagenum'><a id="page339" name="page339"></a>{339}</span> furnished by W. P., which may be
corrected on the best authority, namely, that of Dr. Dibdin himself, as
put forth in his "new and improved edition" of the <i>Bibliomania</i>, with a
supplement, "including a key to the assumed characters in the drama,"
8vo., 1842. According to this supplement we are to interpret as follows:</p>


<table  border="0"  cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="assumed characters in the drama">

<p>A complete "key" is not furnished; but there is reason, I think, to
doubt a few of the other names in W. P.'s list. Moreover, in the edition
of 1842, several other pseudonymes are introduced, which do not appear
in the list; namely, that of Florizel, for Joseph Haslewood; Antigonus;
Baptista; Camillo; Dion; Ferdinand; Gonsalvo; Marcus; and Philander;
respecting whom some of your readers may possibly enlighten us further.

<p><i>High Spirits a Presage of Evil</i> ("N. &amp; Q." <i>passim</i>).&mdash;In a case lately

me to come under the above heading.</p>

<p>In the inquiry at the coroner's inquest, on Feb. 10, 1853, concerning
the death of Eliza Lee, who was supposed to have been murdered by being
thrown into the Regent's Canal, on the evening of the 31st of January,
by her paramour, Thomas Mackett,&mdash;one of the witnesses, Sarah Hermitage,
having deposed that the deceased left her house in company with the
accused at a quarter-past ten o'clock in the evening of the 31st, said
as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Deceased appeared in particularly good spirits, and wanted to
sing. Witness's husband objected; but she would insist upon
having her way, and she sang 'I've wander'd by the
Brook-side.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>The deceased met with her death within half an hour after this.</p>

<p><i>Hogarth's Works.</i>&mdash;Observing an inquiry made in Vol. vii., p. 181. of
"N. &amp; Q." about a picture described in Mrs. Hogarth's sale catalogue of
her husband's effects in 1790, made by Mr. Haggard, I am induced to ask
whether a copy of the catalogue, as far as it relates to the pictures,
would not be a valuable article for your curious miscellany? It appears
from all the lives of Hogarth, that he early in life painted small
family portraits, which were then well esteemed. Are any of them known,
and where are they to be seen? Were they mere portraits, or full-length?
Are any of them engraved? I had once a picture, of about that date,
which represented a large house with a court-yard, and a long garden
wall, with a road and iron gate, something like the old wall and road of
Kensington Gardens, with the master, mistress, and dog walking in front
of the house, and evidently portraits. I always suspected it might be by
Hogarth; but I am very sorry to say I parted with it at auction for a
few shillings. It was (say) two feet square: the figures were about four
inches in height, and dressed in the then fashion. I would further ask
if any oil painting or sketches are known of the minor engravings, such
as "The Laughing Audience," "The Lecture," "The Doctors," &amp;c.?</p>

<p><i>Town Plough</i> (Vol. vi., p. 462.; Vol. vii., p. 129.).&mdash;In Vol vi., p.
462., <span class="smcap">Gastron</span> notices the Town Plough; and it is again noticed
by S. S. S. (Vol. vii., p. 129.) as never having been seen by him
mentioned in ancient churchwardens' accounts.</p>

<p>Not ten years since there was in the belfry of Caston Church,
Northamptonshire, a large clumsy-looking instrument, the use of which
was not apparent at first sight, being a number of rough pieces of
timber, put together as roughly. On nearer inspection, however, it
turned out to be a plough, worm-eaten and decayed, I should think at
least three times as large and heavy as the common ploughs of the time
when I saw the one in question. I have often wondered at the rudeness
and apparent antiquity of that plough, and whether on "Plough Monday" it
had ever made the circuit of the village to assist in levying
contributions.</p>

<p>I have only for a week or two been in the possession of "N. &amp; Q." when
having accidentally, and for the first time, met with the Number for
that week, I could not resist the temptation of becoming the owner of
the complete series. Under these circumstances, you will excuse me if I
am asking a question which may have been answered long since. What is
the origin of Plough Monday? May there not be some connexion with the
Town Plough? and that the custom, which was common when I was a boy, of
going round for contributions on that day, may not have originated in
collecting funds for the keeping in order, and purchasing, if necessary,
the Town Plough?</p>

<p><i>Shoreditch Cross and the painted Window in Shoreditch Church</i> (Vol.
vii., p. 38.).&mdash;I beg to acquaint your correspondent J. W. B. that
although I had long searched for an engraving of Shoreditch Cross, my
labour was lost. The nearest approach to it will be found in a modern
copy of a plan of London, taken in the time of Elizabeth, in which its
position is denoted to be on the west side of Kingsland Road; but, from
records to<span class='pagenum'><a id="page340" name="page340"></a>{340}</span> which I have access, I believe that the cross stood on the
opposite side, between the pump and the house of Dr. Burchell. Most
likely its remains were demolished when the two redoubts were erected at
the London ends of Kingsland and Hackney Roads, to fortify the entrance
to the City, in the year 1642.</p>

<p>The best accounts that I have seen of the painted window are in Dr.
Denne's <i>Register of Benefactions</i> to the parish, compiled in 1745, and
printed in 1778; and Dr. Hughson's <i>History of London</i>, vol. iv. pp.
436, 437.</p>

<p><i>Race for Canterbury</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 219. 268.).&mdash;It is probable that
the lines</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"The man whose place they thought to take,</p>
<p class="i05">Is still alive, and still <i>a Wake</i>,"</p>
</div></div>

<p>are erroneously <i>written</i> on the print referred to; but I have no doubt
of having seen a print of which (with the variation of "ye think" for
"they thought") is the genuine engraved motto.</p>

<p><i>Lady High Sheriff</i> (Vol. vii., p. 236.).&mdash;There is a passage in
Warton's <i>History of English Poetry</i> (Vol. i. p. 194., Tegg's edition)
which will in part answer the Query of your correspondent W. M. It is in
the form of a note, appended to the following lines from the metrical
romance of <i>Ipomydon</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"They come to the castelle yate</p>
<p class="i05">The porter was redy there at,</p>
<p class="i05">The porter to theyme they gan calle,</p>
<p class="i05">And prayd hym go in to the halle,</p>
<p class="i05">And say thy lady gent and fre,</p>
<p class="i05">That comen ar men of ferre contr&egrave;,</p>
<p class="i05">And if it plese hyr, we wolle hyr pray,</p>
<p class="i05">That we myght ete with hyr to-day."</p>
</div></div>

<p>On this passage Warton remarks:</p>

<blockquote><p>"She was lady, by inheritance, of the signory. The female
feudatories exercised all the duties and honours of their
feudal jurisdiction in person. In Spenser, where we read of
the <i>Lady of the Castle</i>, we are to understand such a
character. See a story of a <i>Comtesse</i>, who entertains a
knight in her castle with much gallantry. (<i>M&eacute;m. sur l'Anc.
Chev.</i>, ii. 69.) It is well known that anciently in England
ladies were sheriffs of counties."</p></blockquote>

<p>To this note of Warton's, Park adds another, which I also give as being
more conclusive on the subject. It is as follow:</p>

<blockquote><p>["Margaret, Countess of Richmond, was a justice of peace. Sir
W. Dugdale tells us that Ela, widow of William, Earl of
Salisbury, executed the sheriff's office for the county of
Wilts, in different parts of the reign of Henry III. (See
<i>Baronage</i>, vol. i. p. 177.) From Fuller's <i>Worthies</i> we find
that Elizabeth, widow of Thomas Lord Clifford, was sheriffess
of Westmoreland for many years; and from Pennant's <i>Scottish
Tour</i> we learn that for the same county Anne, the celebrated
Countess of Dorset, Pembroke and Montgomery, often sat in
person as sheriffess. Yet Riston doubted of facts to
substantiate Mr. Warton's assertion. See his Obs. p. 10., and
reply in the <i>Gent. Mag. 1782</i>, p. 573.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Park</span>."]</p></blockquote>

<p>I can answer part of W. M.'s Query, by a reference to a personage who
could not have been very far from being the first instance of the kind
(Query, was she?).</p>

<blockquote><p>"About this time (1202) Gerard de Camville, his old and
faithful adherent, was restored by John to the possession of
the honours of which he had been deprived by King Richard; and
it is a remarkable circumstance that, on the death of the said
Gerard, in the eighteenth year of the king's reign, his widow,
Nichola Camville (who is described by an ancient historian as
being 'a martial woman of great courage and address') had the
sheriffalty of the county of Lincoln committed to her; which
honourable and important trust was continued to her by a grant
of Henry III.," &amp;c.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Burial of an unclaimed Corpse</i> (Vol. vii., p. 262.).&mdash;E. G. R.'s
question is easily answered. The parish of Keswick proved that some
years before they had buried a body found on a piece of land. This was
evidence of reputation that at the time of the burial the land was in
Keswick, otherwise the parishioners would not have taken on themselves
this work of uncalled-for benevolence. The fact of their having incurred
an expense, which, unless the land was in their parish, would have been
the burden of Markshall, satisfied the commissioner that the land must
have belonged to Keswick. I have no doubt this was the reason, though I
never heard of the question in connexion with Keswick and Markshall.
Battersea Rise, I heard when a boy, had formerly belonged to Clapham,
and been given to Battersea for the same reason as E. G. R. states to
have been the cause of Markshall losing its territory to Keswick.</p>

<p><i>Surname of Allan</i> (Vol. vii., p. 205.).&mdash;I think A. S. A. will find
that this name was introduced into Britain from Normandy. It occurs in
early Norman times as a personal name, and afterwards as a patronymic.
Thus Alan, the son of Flathald, who had the castle of Oswestry granted
him by the Conqueror, had a son, William Fitz-Alan, ancestor of the
great baronial house of Arundel. In the <i>Hundred Rolls</i>, temp. Edward
I., it is very common under the orthographies of <i>fil. Alan</i>, <i>fil.<span class='pagenum'><a id="page341" name="page341"></a>{341}</span>
Alain</i>, <i>Alayn</i>, <i>Aleyn</i>, <i>Aleyne</i>, <i>Aleynes</i>, <i>Aleynys</i>, &amp;c. Allen has
always remained a baptismal name, and hence it is probable that there is
no more affinity between the numerous families now bearing it as a
surname, than between the various Thompsons, Williamses, and others of
this class. The MacAllans of Scotland may have a separate Celtic source,
though it is far likelier that this name (like MacEdward, MacGeorge, and
numerous others) is the English appellative with the patronymic Mac
prefixed.</p>

marble, affixed to the wall of the choir of St. Patrick's Cathedral. The
remains of the duke were removed to this cathedral immediately after the
battle of the Boyne; and on the 10th July, 1690, they were deposited
under the altar. The relatives of this great man having neglected to
raise any monument to his memory, Dean Swift undertook and caused the
above slab to be erected, having first vainly applied to the connexions
of the deceased. His sword is in the possession of the society of the

<p><i>Pilgrimages to the Holy Land</i> (Vol. v., p. 289.).&mdash;There is still
another book to be added to the curious list of old pilgrimages to the
Holy Land, furnished by your correspondent <span class="smcap">Peregrine A.</span> I
derive my knowledge of it from Brunet's <i>Manuel</i>, sub voce
<span class="smcap">Capodilista (Gabriele)</span>, where it is described as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Itinerario di Terra Santa, e del Monte Sinai." (Without date
or printer) 4to.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is a journal of a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, made in the year 1458
by a Padua nobleman, accompanied by a relative, Antonio Capodilista, a
canon of the same place, and several other noble personages. It is one
of the earliest productions of the press at Perugia, and the date
assigned to it by M. Brunet is 1472, but by Vermiglioli 1473 or 1474.
The latter authority, in his <i>Principi della Stampa in Perugia</i>, calls
it "Veramente un prezioso cimelio di tipografia e bibliografia." I am
anxious to know where a copy of this very rare work is deposited, as I
have been told that there is none at the British Museum.</p>

<p><i>Album</i> (Vol. vii., p. 235.).&mdash;The origin and the earliest notice of
this kind of friendly memorial book is to be traced to the registers of
the deceased that were formerly kept in every church and monastery. Such
a book was called the <i>album</i>, <i>i. e.</i> the blank book, in which the
names of the friends and benefactors to the church or monastery were
recorded, that they might be prayed for at their decease, and on their
anniversaries. The earliest writer belonging to this country who uses
the word is the Venerable Beda, who in his<span class='pagenum'><a id="page342" name="page342"></a>{342}</span> preface to his prose life of
St. Cuthbert, written previous to the year 721, reminds Bishop Eadfrith
that his name was registered in the album at Lindisfarne, "in albo
vestr&aelig; sanct&aelig; congregationis." (<i>Bed&aelig; Opera Minora</i>, p. 47., ed.
Stevenson.) Elsewhere Beda calls this book "the annal" (<i>Hist. Eccles.</i>,
lib. iv. c. 14.). At a later period it was called, both in England and
abroad, the <i>Liber Vit&aelig;, or Book of Life</i>, a name borrowed from St. Paul
(Philippians, iv. 3.).</p>

<p>The earliest specimen of an English album, and perhaps the most elegant
one that this or any other country ever produced, may be seen in the
British Museum (<i>Cotton MSS.</i>, Domitian VII.). It is the Album, or Book
of Life, of the monastery of Durham. Nor need we add that this album
affords a relief to the eye wearied with looking over the pages of a
modern album, and to the mind sick of the endless but monotonous
repetition of imaginary ruins, love sonnets, and moss roses.</p>

<p><i>Gesmas and Desmas</i> (Vol. vii., p. 238.).&mdash;For the information of your
correspondent A. B. R., I copy the passage referred to by you in the
disputed Gospel of Nicodemus, formerly called the Acts of Pontius
Pilate. The extract is from an English version, printed for William
Hone, Ludgate Hill, 1820:</p>

<blockquote><p>"But one of the two thieves who were crucified with Jesus,
whose name was <i>Gestas</i>, said to Jesus, If thou art the
Christ, deliver thyself and us."&mdash;vii. 10.</p>

<p>"But the thief who was crucified on his right hand, whose name
was <i>Dimas</i>, answering, rebuked him, and said, Dost not thou
fear God, who art condemned to this punishment? We indeed
receive rightly and justly the demerit of our actions; but
this Jesus, what evil hath he done?"&mdash;vi. 11.</p>

<p>"After this, groaning, he said to Jesus, Lord, remember me
when Thou comest into Thy kingdom."&mdash;vi. 12.</p></blockquote>

<p>It thus appears the names have been differently received: here they
appear <small>GESTAS</small> the <i>im</i>penitent, and <small>DIMAS</small>
the penitent.</p>

<p>I have a fine old engraving, nineteen inches by fourteen, bearing date
"Greg. Huret, Lugd. inv. et sculp. 1664;" published in Paris, <i>cum priv.
Regis</i>.</p>

<p>The three crosses, with their inscriptions (each in Hebrew, Greek, and
Latin), appear.</p>

<p>The Latin on the cross of the thief on the right hand of our Lord (and,
from the expression of countenance, confessed the penitent) is
<small><i>DISMAS</i> LATRO</small>: the other is <small><i>GESTAS</i>
LATRO</small>.</p>

<p>"<i>Quod fuit esse</i>" (Vol. vii., p. 235.).&mdash;Allow me to suggest the
following meaning of the epitaph in Lavenham churchyard, which is the
subject of A. B. R.'s Query. The word <i>est</i> has evidently been omitted
in the third line: with this restored, the lines will read as a couple
of hexameters:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Quod fuit esse, quod est; quod non fuit esse, quod esse;</p>
<p class="i05">Esse quod (est), non esse; quod est, non est, erit, esse."</p>
</div></div>

<p>And the literal meaning, will be: "What was existence, is that which
lies here; that which was not existence, is that which is existence; to
be what is now, is not to be; that which is now, is not existence, but
will be hereafter."</p>

<p>This, perhaps, is as enigmatical as the original: but the following
lines will render the meaning plainer, though it is difficult to
preserve the brevity of the Latin in an English version:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">All that I really was lies here in dust;</p>
<p class="i0">That which was death before is life, I trust.</p>
<p class="i0">To be what <i>is</i>, is not, I ween, to <i>be</i>;</p>
<p class="i0"><i>Is</i> not, but <i>will be</i> in eternity.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="ohdash">&mdash;</span>&mdash; Rectory, Hereford.</p>

<p>I think your correspondent A. B. R. is not quite correct in his version
of the epitaph of which he inquires the sense. It is evidently intended
for two hexameter verses, and, as I have heard it, runs thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Quod fuit esse, quod est; quod non fuit esse, quod esse;</p>
<p class="i05">Esse quod est, non esse; quod est, non est, erit, esse."</p>
</div></div>

<p>I inclose a similar epitaph in another churchyard (the <i>locale</i> of which
I do not know), which may serve to elucidate its meaning:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"That which a Being was, what is it? show:</p>
<p class="i05">That being which it was, it is not now.</p>
<p class="i05">To be what 'tis is not to be, you see;</p>
<p class="i05">That which now is not shall a Being be."</p>

<p><i>Straw Bail</i> (Vol. vii., p. 85.).&mdash;In connexion with, though not as a
reply to, <span class="smcap">Mr. Curtis's</span> Query touching the origin of the
expression "A man of straw," I beg to bring under notice a phrase I
heard for the first time a few days ago, but which may nevertheless be
well known to others. A seaman, talking to me of a strike for wages
among the crew of a ship, said that the captain, as the rate of wages
had not been raised, had manned his ship with a "lot of straw-yarders."
On my asking the meaning of the expression, I was told that a
"straw-yarder" was a man about the docks who had never been to sea, and
knew little or nothing of the duties of a seaman.</p>

<p><i>Pearl</i> (Vol. vi., p. 578.; Vol. vii., pp. 18. 166.).&mdash;In the Old
German, <i>merikrioz</i> is pearl; and in the Ang.-Sax. it is
<i>meregreot</i>,&mdash;the latter from <i>mere</i>, sea, and <i>greot</i>, grit, sand, or
<i>grot</i>, an<span class='pagenum'><a id="page343" name="page343"></a>{343}</span> atom. These are so similar to the Greek <i>margaritas</i>, and
the <i>margarita</i> of the sister language (Latin), that we may be excused
believing they have a common origin; more especially as we find the
first syllable (at least?) in almost all the cognate Indo-Germanic or
Indo-European languages: Latin, <i>mare</i>; Celt., <i>mor</i>; Gothic, <i>marei</i>;
Sax., <i>m&aelig;re</i> or <i>mere</i>; Old Germ., <i>meri</i>; Slavon., <i>more</i> and <i>morze</i>;
Swed., <i>mar</i>; Iceland, <i>mar</i>; Esthon., <i>merri</i>; Lett., <i>marrios</i>.</p>

<p>Among modern languages, we have,&mdash;Span., <i>margarita</i>; Ital., <i>margarita</i>
and <i>maugherita</i>; Fr., <i>marguerite</i>, but used only in the proverb, "Il
ne faut pas jeter les marguerites devant les pourceaux." Johnson,
Webster, and Halliwell give <i>margarite</i> as an English word. Probably all
derived from the Latin.</p>

<p>At the same time, although not occurring (as far as I am aware) in
either Greek or Latin, the word <i>pearl</i> is found in some shape in most
of the same Indo-Germanic languages: thus, Ital. and Span., <i>perla</i>;
Low. Lat., <i>perla</i>; French, <i>perle</i>; Eng., <i>pearl</i>; Dan., <i>paarl</i>;
Swed., <i>perla</i> or <i>p[)a]rla</i>; Bohem., <i>perle</i>; Ang.-Sax., <i>pearl</i> and
<i>p&aelig;rl</i>; Low. Sax., <i>berel</i>. Webster says the word <i>pearl</i> may be
radically the same as <i>beryl</i>. In the Celtic we find, Irish, <i>pearla</i>,
and Welsh <i>perlyn</i>.</p>

<p>The Germans derive <i>pearl</i> from <i>beer</i>, a berry, making thus <i>berle</i> or
<i>beerlein</i>; as in Latin <i>bacca</i> also means a pearl.</p>

<p>Some of your correspondents can, no doubt, inform us whether any
analogous words to <i>pearl</i> and <i>margarita</i> exist in the Sanscrit?</p>

he was accompanied by Master Eustace, Dean of Salisbury, for the purpose
of his conducting such business of the Great Seal as might be necessary
while the king remained abroad. The Doncaster Charter appears to have

obliged if J. E. J. will give me a copy of Eustace's title, and the date

<p>"<i>Goe, soule, the bodies guest</i>" (Vol. vii., p. 175.).&mdash;Your

ringing of bells in populous cities hath chased away thunder,

the concussion of the air, and not from the sound."</p>

driving away divels and tempests; and for this purpose did
invite many rich godfathers, who were to touch the rope while
the bell was exorcised, and its name invoked (unto which all
the people must answer). And that a banquet was used to be
made thereupon, at the cost of the layicks, amounting in
little towns to a hundred florins, whither the godfathers were

<span class="smcap">Leicestriensis</span>, relates rather to a religious assembly or
meeting established by authority in the reign of Elizabeth, and designed
as a check on the growing tendency towards Puritanism, which marked that
period. In this diocese (at that time the diocese of Chester) Bishop
Downham instituted a "monthly exercise," which was confirmed by his
successor Dr. Chadderton, in an injunction bearing date Sept. 1, 1585.
(See Appendix to Strype's <i>Annals</i>, vol. i.) It is there decreed that
all parsons, vicars, curates, and schoolmasters shall resort to this
exercise, there either to speak or write; and certain penalties are
enforced on any neglect of its observance. In the churchwardens'
accounts of this parish is an entry of similar import to that quoted by
<span class="smcap">Leicestriensis</span>: "1656, Pd. for minister diner at the exercise
day, 00.00.06," the only perceptible difference being in the degree of
hospitality extended to the clergy by their entertainers.</p>

Charles I., he was one of the court musicians, and his name occurs among
the "Musicians for the Lutes and Voices," in a privy seal, dated Dec.
20, 1625, exempting the musicians belonging to the court from the
payment of subsidies.</p>

<p>John Daniel's <i>Songs</i> were "printed by T. E. for Thomas Adams, at the
Signe of the White Lyon, Paule's Church Yard, folio, 1606." They are
dedicated, in rhyme, to "Mrs. Anne Greene, the worthy Daughter to Sir
William Greene, of Milton, Knight."</p>

<p><i>English Bishops deprived by Queen Elizabeth</i>, 1559 (Vol. vi., pp. 100.
203.; Vol. vii., p. 260.).&mdash;I regret that I am unable to furnish A. S.
A. with any additional information respecting the Marian bishops. None
of the authorities I used give the dates he requires. Possibly, Mr.
Charles Butler's <i>Historical Memoires of the English, Irish, and
Scottish Catholics</i>, 4 vols. 8vo., 1822, might answer his Queries.</p>

<p>I have ascertained from Calamy's <i>Life and Times</i> (vol. i. p. 409.),
that Thomas White, the<span class='pagenum'><a id="page345" name="page345"></a>{345}</span> deprived Bishop of Peterborough, died in London,
May 30, 1698; and that Robert Frampton, the deprived Bishop of
Gloucester, died May 25, 1708 (vol. ii. p. 119.).</p>

<p>"<i>Jenny's Bawbee</i>" (Vol. vii., p. 207.).&mdash;This is a very old song, a
fragment of which (all we have) appeared in David Herd's <i>Collection of
Ancient and Modern Scottish Songs</i>, 2 vols. 12mo., Edinb. 1776. As it is
very short, I quote it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"An' a' that e'er my Jenny had,</p>
<p class="i05">My Jenny had, my Jenny had,</p>
<p class="i05">A' that e'er my Jenny had,</p>
<p class="i4">Was ae bawbee.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"There's your plack, and my plack,</p>
<p class="i05">An' your plack, an' my plack,</p>
<p class="i05">An' my plack, an' your plack,</p>
<p class="i4">An' Jenny's bawbee.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"We'll put it a' in the pint-stoup,</p>
<p class="i05">The pint-stoup, the pint-stoup,</p>
<p class="i05">We'll put it in the pint-stoup,</p>
<p class="i4">And birle't a' three."</p>
</div></div>

<p>There is a capital song founded upon this rude fragment, by the late Sir
Alexander Boswell. It was published anonymously in 1803, and commences
thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"I met four chaps yon birks amang,</p>
<p class="i05">Wi hinging lugs and faces lang;</p>
<p class="i05">I spier'd at neebour Bauldy Strang,</p>
<p class="i4">Wha's they I see?</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Quo' he, Ilk cream-fac'd pawky chiel</p>
<p class="i05">Thought he was cunning as the diel,</p>
<p class="i05">And here they cam' awa to steal</p>
<p class="i4">Jenny's bawbee."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Copies of this latter song may be seen in Johnson's <i>Scottish Musical
Museum</i>, edit. 1839, vol. v. p. 435.; and in Graham's <i>Songs of
Scotland</i>, 1848, vol. ii. p. 48.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Edward F. Rimbault.</span></p>

<p>The old Scotch ballad with the above title, on which Sir Alexander
Boswell, Bart., founded his humorous song, with the same name, may be
found in <i>The Book of Scottish Songs</i>, recently published in <i>The
Illustrated London Library</i>, p. 229.</p>

<p class="author">J. K. R. W.</p>


<p><i>Irish Convocation</i> (Vol. vi., p. 317.).&mdash;I am unable to answer <span class="smcap">W.
Fraser's</span> Queries as to when the Irish Convocation last met, and
where their deliberations are recorded; but that gentleman will find
some account of its nature and constitution in a recently published
pamphlet, entitled <i>The Jerusalem Chamber</i>, by the Rev. H. Caswall,
M.A., pp. 39, 40.</p>

<p><i>Spontaneous Combustion</i> (Vol. vii., p. 286.).&mdash;Is there such a thing;
meaning, I presume, of the <i>human body</i>? One of the latest and best
authenticated cases is given in <i>The Abstainer's Journal</i> (Glasgow), No.
III., March, 1853, p. 54. In the narrative is included the official
medical report from the <i>Journal of Medical Science</i>, Dec. 1852.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">W. C. Trevelyan.</span></p>


<p><i>Do the Sun's Rays put out the Fire?</i> (Vol. vii., p. 285.).&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Why does the sun, shining, on a fire, make it dull, and often
put it out?</p>

<p>"1st. Because the air (being rarefied by the sunshine) flows
more slowly to the fire; and</p>

<p>"2ndly. The chemical action of the sun's rays is detrimental
to combustion.</p>

<p>"The sun's rays are composed of three parts; lighting,
heating, and actinic or chemical rays. These latter interfere
with the process of combustion."</p></blockquote>

<p>The above is an extract from Rev. Dr. Brewer's <i>Guide to the Scientific
Knowledge of Things Familiar</i>, 6th edition, p. 50., which may perhaps
prove interesting to C. W. B. At p. 58. of the same book, H. A. B. will
find, I think, an answer in the affirmative to his Query (Vol. vii., p.
286.): "Is there such a thing as spontaneous combustion?"</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

<p>If any of the readers of Mr. Hudson Turner's volume on Domestic
Architecture have been under the apprehension that the death of that
able antiquary would necessarily lead, if not to the abandonment of that
work, to its being completed in a more imperfect manner than Mr. Turner
would have completed it, we can assure them that such apprehension is
entirely groundless. We have now before us the second part, entitled
<i>Some Account of Domestic Architecture in England from Edward I. to
Richard II., with Notices of Foreign Examples, and numerous
Illustrations of existing Remains from original Drawings. By the Editor
of the Glossary of Architecture.</i> The editing of the work is indeed most
creditable to Mr. Parker, who, though he modestly confesses that if he
had not known that he could safely calculate upon much valuable
assistance from others more competent than himself, he would never have
ventured to undertake it at all, had already given proof of his fitness
for the task by the <i>Glossary of Architecture</i> with which his name has
been so long and so honourably connected. The work, which supplies a
deficiency which the architectural student has<span class='pagenum'><a id="page346" name="page346"></a>{346}</span> long felt, is produced
in the same handsome style, and with the same profuseness of
illustration, as its predecessor, and will be found valuable not only to
arch&aelig;ologists who study history in brick and stone, but also to those
who search in the memorials of bygone ages for illustrations of manners
and customs, and of that greater subject than all, the history of our
social progress.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Books Received</span>.&mdash;<i>History of England from the Peace of Utrecht
to the Peace of Versailles</i>, 1713&mdash;1783, by Lord Mahon, vol. ii.
1720&mdash;1740. This second volume of the new and cheaper edition of Lord
Mahon's work extends from the accession of Walpole and Townshend to
office in 1720, to the Declaration of War against Spain in 1739, and
contains a valuable appendix of original papers.&mdash;<i>The Annals of Roger
de Hoveden, from</i> <small>A.D.</small> 732 <i>to</i> <small>A.D.</small> 1201,
<i>translated from the Latin, with Notes and Illustrations</i>, by Henry T.
Riley. Vol. I. <small>A.D.</small> 732 to <small>A.D.</small> 1180, is a
new volume of the valuable series of Translations of Early English
Chronicles, which is to give so important a character to Bohn's
<i>Antiquarian Library</i>.&mdash;<i>Thomas &agrave; Becket and other Poems</i>, by Patrick
Scott. Notices of new poems scarcely fall within our vocation, but Mr.
Scott is a true poet, and we cannot refuse to praise the present volume,
and more especially the little poem which owes its origin to the notice
of the opening of the coffin of Lady Audrey Leigh in our 156th
Number.&mdash;<i>The Family Shakspeare, &amp;c.</i>, by Thomas Bowdler, Vol. V. This
fifth volume contains Troilus and Cressida, Coriolanus, Julius C&aelig;sar,
Antony and Cleopatra, and Cymbeline.</p>

obtain) of sending green ribbons, called willows, tied round bridal
cards, to rejected suitors of the bride, is no doubt derived from that

the willow "is a sad tree, whereof such as have lost their love make
their mourning garments."</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span>. <i>A Subscriber would be obliged by</i> H. K. (Vol. vi.,

<p>GOETHE'S FAUST: With Copious English Notes, Grammatical, Philological,
and Exegetical, for Students of the German Language. By FALK LEBAHN, Ph.
D., Author of "German in One Volume," &amp;c.</p>

<p>&#8258; The Grammatical Notes contain the whole of the Text, in German and
English, classified according to rules of grammar. "Faust" is thus
brought within the reach of the merest beginner. In the Exegetical
Notes, the Editor has endeavoured to render Goethe's own meaning
strictly: and where his interpretation differs from those of his
predecessors, Goethe himself is adduced as authority, the supporting
passages from his other works being given in German. Copious extracts
from other German authors are also given in the original.</p>
